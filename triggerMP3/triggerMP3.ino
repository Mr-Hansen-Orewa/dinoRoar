 This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).
 
 This example shows how to play a given track (track001.mp3 for example) from the SD card when a GPIO pin goes low. 
 This code monitors A0 through A5. If A0 is pulled low then track 1 plays. If A5 is pulled low then the track # simply advances.
 
 This code is heavily based on the "MP3 PlayTrack" example code. Please be sure to review it for more comments and gotchas.
 
 While track is playing, Arduino scans to see if pins change. If pins change, stop playing track, check pins again to get 
 trigger # and then decide what new track to play.
